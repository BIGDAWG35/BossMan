# Hermes First Operating Blueprint
**Version:** 1.2
**Date:** 2026-05-08
**Owner:** BossMan (Marcelo's Hermes orchestrator)
**Status:** Canonical — governs all work routing

---

## Overview

This document defines Hermes as the **primary control plane** for Marcelo's operations, with LBC35/OpenClaw as a **delegated execution layer** under BossMan's orchestration. All new work routes through Hermes. OpenClaw executes only what BossMan explicitly assigns.

---

## Core Operating Principle

> **BossMan routes. OpenClaw executes. Hermes knows.**
>
> Hermes (specifically BossMan via the bossman profile) is the single orchestration authority. All incoming tasks, questions, and work requests flow through BossMan first. BossMan decides what to do, what to delegate, and what to archive — never the other way around.

---

## Profile Roles

| Profile | Role | Authority |
|---------|------|----------|
| **bossman** | Orchestrator, router, planner, approver | PRIMARY — routes all work |
| **builder** | Code, dashboards, scripts, repos | Executes what bossman assigns |
| **ops** | PM2, runtime, ports, infra | Executes what bossman assigns |
| **trading** | Market research, signals | Executes what bossman assigns |
| **content** | YouTube, scripts, docs | Executes what bossman assigns |
| **LBC35/OpenClaw** | Legacy executor | DEMOTED — delegated work only |

---

## Model Stack Policy

| Model | Role | When to Use |
|-------|------|------------|
| **MiniMax 2.7** | Primary brain | Everything, all day |
| **DeepSeek** | Analysis backup | MiniMax hits ceiling on complexity |
| **OpenAI** | Production text backup | Need clean production code/docs |
| **Claude** | Long-form reasoning backup | All models conflict or stall |

---

## Kanban Board

**Board:** `bossman`
**DB:** `~/.hermes/kanban/boards/bossman/kanban.db`
**Rule:** All work goes on the board. No work happens off-board.

### Columns / Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `inbox` | Raw incoming, not triaged |
| `planned` | Triaged, queued |
| `running` | Work in progress |
| `client_testing` | Build ready for testers |
| `feedback_review` | Processing feedback |
| `blocked` | Waiting on something |
| `awaiting_approval` | Needs Marcelo's sign-off |
| `done` | Completed |

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Critical — must address before anything else |
| 2 | High — schedule this phase |
| 3 | Medium — backfill when capacity allows |

### Card Lifecycle

```
inbox → planned → running → client_testing → feedback_review → done
                 ↑
           (blocked ← awaiting_approval)
```

## Routing Rules

| Incoming task type | → Assign to | Via |
|--------------------|-------------|-----|
| Routing, planning, approval decisions | `bossman` | Direct |
| Code, features, dashboards, scripts, Git work | `builder` (Hermes) | BossMan assigns |
| Runtime, PM2, ports, infra, servers | `ops` (Hermes) | BossMan assigns |
| Market research, trading signals, crypto | `trading` (Hermes) | BossMan assigns |
| YouTube, content, scripts, docs | `content` (Hermes) | BossMan assigns |
| Legacy OpenClaw tasks, microapps | `lbc35` | **Handoff packet ONLY** |
| One-off research, reading, cross-repo synthesis | `lbc35` | **Handoff packet ONLY** |
| Tasks not matching above | `bossman` | Escalate |

**Rule:** LBC35 receives work **exclusively** via handoff packet. No other routing path to LBC35 is valid.

---

## Handoff Packet Format (Standard)

### BossMan → Agent

```
From: BossMan
To: [agent_id]
Task ID: [kanban_card_id]

### Deliverables
- [ ] [Deliverable 1 — specific and testable]
- [ ] [Deliverable 2]

### Constraints
- [Hard constraint 1 — what NOT to do]
- [Hard constraint 2]

### Source Docs
- [File path] — required reading before starting
- [File path] — reference only

### Success Criteria
[How BossMan evaluates completion]

### Escalation
If blocked: comment on card + @mention BossMan. Do not wait.

*Generated by BossMan. All work authorized here.*
```

### Agent → BossMan (completion report)

```
From: [agent_id]
To: BossMan
Task ID: [kanban_card_id]
Status: ✅ Complete / ⚠️ Partial / 🔴 Blocked
Completed: [ISO timestamp]

### What Was Done
[Description of actions taken]

### Deliverables
- [x] [Deliverable 1] — ✅ done / ⚠️ partial
- [ ] [Deliverable 2] — reason if not done

### Files Modified
- [Path] — [change summary]

### Issues / Blockers
[Any remaining issues]

*Reported by [agent_id] to BossMan via Kanban card [ID].*
```

## LBC35 Constraint Checklist

LBC35 **must NOT** under any circumstances:
- [ ] Self-assign tasks — wait for BossMan handoff packet
- [ ] Create new Kanban cards without BossMan approval
- [ ] Modify PM2 processes, cron jobs, or system services
- [ ] Retire or alter dashboards
- [ ] Access or modify Perplexity Spaces
- [ ] Change routing rules or agent profiles
- [ ] Create new projects or change architecture
- [ ] Modify openclaw.json or agent SOUL files
- [ ] Access services outside delegated scope
- [ ] Override BossMan decisions

LBC35 **may** without asking:
- Use exec, read, write, image_generate, video_generate, music_generate, tts, subagents, cron, sessions tools freely within assigned task scope
- Ask BossMan for clarification when task is ambiguous
- Report blockers promptly via Kanban card comment

## Telegram Mobile Controls

BossMan is already connected to Telegram. Send commands directly from your phone — BossMan interprets them and routes to the Kanban board.

### Quick Commands

| Action | Telegram message |
|--------|-----------------|
| Create card | `new card [title]` |
| List my cards | `list my cards` |
| List blocked | `list blocked cards` |
| Show card | `show [card id]` |
| Move card | `move [id] to [status]` |
| Add comment | `comment on [id]: [message]` |
| Assign | `assign [id] to [profile]` |
| Block | `block [id] because [reason]` |
| Unblock | `unblock [id]` |
| Request approval | `move [id] to awaiting approval` |

**Valid statuses:** `todo` | `planned` | `running` | `blocked` | `done` | `awaiting_approval`

**Profiles:** `bossman` | `builder` | `ops` | `trading` | `content` | `lbc35`

> Full command reference: `~/.hermes/knowledge/TELEGRAM_COMMANDS.md`

### Perplexity & Spaces Tool Selection Policy

When to use each tool:

| Tool | When to Use |
|---|---|
| **Perplexity Pro + Spaces** | Live research, Space-specific context, Deep Research reasoning |
| **Browser QA** | Normal web-app testing, DOM-level troubleshooting, localhost app flows |
| **Hermes Computer Use** | Real app/PWA/native UI on Mac mini (Perplexity app, Basecamp PWA, native app) |
| **Local code/CLI/DB** | Implementation, backend debugging, schema inspection |

**Perplexity ownership:** BossMan owns all Perplexity/Spaces coordination. Sub-agents may NOT access or modify Spaces without explicit BossMan assignment.

**Verification rule (all agents):** Any Space update (title, description, prompt, docs, deletions) must be confirmed after execution. Update is not complete until right Space was updated, content is correct, metadata is correct, obsolete content removed, result matches blueprint.

> Full Perplexity workflow: `~/.hermes/SOUL.md` — "Perplexity & Spaces Coordination"

### Example Workflows

**New task from anywhere:**
```
"new card Add Binance trading pause — assign to builder — priority 1"
→ BossMan creates card, assigns to builder, replies with card ID
```

**Quick board check:**
```
"what's blocked"
→ BossMan replies with all blocked cards and reasons
```

**Approve and close:**
```
"move t_1a4193ba to done"
→ BossMan marks done, replies confirmation
```

### What NOT to Do via Telegram

Still requires explicit BossMan approval:
- Stop/start PM2 services
- Change cron jobs
- Retire dashboards
- Modify Perplexity Spaces
- Delete cards
