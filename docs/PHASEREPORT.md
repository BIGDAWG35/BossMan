# PHASEREPORT.md — Hermes phase / standard formalization log

**Purpose:** Append-only log of major formalizations, policy adoptions, and phase closures. Each entry has: date, scope, what was codified, where, and link to the kanban card.

**Owner:** BossMan Hermes
**Convention:** Newest entry on top. Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD — <title>`

## 2026-06-13 — Concurrent-edit resolution: OBSIDIAN_VAULT_WORKFLOW.md

**What happened:** A separate parallel BossMan session (the `bossman-profile`) was working on `~/Desktop/CLAW-Backup/` (Marcelo's primary personal Obsidian vault) and committed `docs/OBSIDIAN_VAULT_WORKFLOW.md` to the BossMan repo at commit `04a103d`. That doc is canonical for CLAW-Backup, with focus on vault identification, security boundaries, and daily-note workflows.

My session (also on `t_a08658cc`) was formalizing the `~/Obsidian/Hermes/` vault, a different scope. I wrote `~/.hermes/knowledge/OBSIDIAN_VAULT_WORKFLOW.md` (12,376 bytes) covering the Hermes project vault.

Then:
- The other session's content overwrote my local `~/.hermes/knowledge/OBSIDIAN_VAULT_WORKFLOW.md` (a race condition on the canonical path).
- My `cp` overwrote the repo's `docs/OBSIDIAN_VAULT_WORKFLOW.md` (commit `9e74c59`).
- I noticed via `git log`, reverted my overwriting commit (`a188942`), and re-added only the 3 genuinely-new files (LEARNED, PHASEREPORT, AUTOMATION_INVENTORY) at `32d5594`.
- I restored my version to the local `~/.hermes/knowledge/OBSIDIAN_VAULT_WORKFLOW.md` with §0 "Scope clarification" so future sessions don't confuse the two vaults.

**Learnings codified:**
- The two vaults (`~/Obsidian/Hermes/` vs `~/Desktop/CLAW-Backup/`) have different scopes and different canonical docs.
- Concurrent BossMan sessions writing to the same canonical path is a real risk. The fix: §10 of OBSIDIAN_VAULT_WORKFLOW.md now documents that "last writer wins, but both sessions log the conflict on the kanban card and the next audit reconciles."
- Repo-side: the BossMan repo's `docs/OBSIDIAN_VAULT_WORKFLOW.md` (commit `04a103d`) is canonical for CLAW-Backup, NOT for `~/Obsidian/Hermes/`. My version lives only in Hermes knowledge.

**Status:** Resolved. Two separate canonical docs, each with a clear scope.

## 2026-06-12 — Obsidian vault structure and audit workflow formalized

**Scope:** Permanent operating standard for the Hermes Obsidian vault at `~/Obsidian/Hermes/`. Codifies the 11-folder + `_Templates/` layout, the save order, the project structure, and the monthly audit + bi-monthly review cadence.

**What was created / updated:**
- `~/.hermes/knowledge/OBSIDIAN_VAULT_WORKFLOW.md` — full canonical blueprint (11,077 bytes, 13 sections, version history).
- `~/.hermes/knowledge/OPERATING_BLUEPRINT.md` — appended "Obsidian Vault Layout (Permanent — 2026-06-12)" section summarizing the rule.
- `~/.hermes/knowledge/LEARNED.md` — created with rule L-001 (Obsidian vault structure) + 4 other cross-cutting rules.
- `~/.hermes/knowledge/PHASEREPORT.md` — this entry.
- `~/Obsidian/Hermes/` — 11 standard folders + `_Templates/` created. Existing notes (Perplexity Spaces, Systems, Projects) preserved and aligned to new layout where safe.
- `~/Obsidian/Hermes/70_Workflows/Obsidian Vault Workflow.md` — human-readable mirror of the canonical doc.
- `~/Obsidian/Hermes/01_Dashboard/Dashboard.md` — single landing page linking active projects, phase report, blueprint, services map, workflows.
- `~/Obsidian/Hermes/_Templates/Project Template.md` + `Workflow Template.md` — note templates.
- `~/.hermes/scripts/obsidian-vault-audit.sh` + `obsidian-vault-review.sh` — monthly + bi-monthly audit scripts.
- Cron jobs to schedule the audits.

**Save order codified (4 steps):**
1. Write to `~/.hermes/knowledge/`.
2. Mirror to `~/Obsidian/Hermes/`.
3. Sync to `~/Repos/BossMan/docs/` and commit.
4. Spaces content via existing `sync_perplexity_spaces.sh`.

**Conflict resolution:** Hermes knowledge wins. Always. If Obsidian and Hermes diverge, Hermes is right and Obsidian gets corrected.

**Conflict resolution note (added 2026-06-13):** A separate parallel session of BossMan was working on `~/Desktop/CLAW-Backup/` (Marcelo's primary personal Obsidian vault) and committed `docs/OBSIDIAN_VAULT_WORKFLOW.md` to the BossMan repo (commit `04a103d`) for that vault. My version (in `~/.hermes/knowledge/`) covers the **`~/Obsidian/Hermes/`** vault, not CLAW-Backup. The repo doc was preserved; my version lives only in Hermes knowledge. See §0 "Scope clarification" at the top of this file.

**Synced to GitHub at:** `~/Repos/BossMan/docs/LEARNED.md`, `PHASEREPORT.md`, `AUTOMATION_INVENTORY.md` (commits `32d5594` for these 3, plus the existing `OPERATING_BLUEPRINT.md`). The OBSIDIAN_VAULT_WORKFLOW.md in `docs/` is the OTHER session's version (CLAW-Backup scope) and was **not** overwritten.

**Kanban card:** `t_a08658cc` (status: `ready` at time of this entry; will be `done` after verification).

**Next review:** 2026-07-01 (monthly audit), 2026-07-01 (bi-monthly review — first one).

## 2026-06-12 — Kanban policy upgrade (all work on the board)

**Scope:** Codified the rule that every real Telegram request creates or updates a kanban card. Found and fixed 30 cards in illegal statuses, 6 ghost `task_runs`, 73 active cards untagged by project.

**What was created / updated:**
- `~/.hermes/knowledge/SOUL.md` § "Kanban — All Work Goes On The Board (Hard rule — 2026-06-12)"
- 4 scripts: `kanban-snapshot.py`, `kanban-status-migration.py`, `kanban-project-backfill.py`, `kanban-runs-gc.py`
- 30 status migrations, 6 task_runs terminations, 73 project tags

**Kanban card:** `t_kanban_policy_upgrade_20260612` (done).

## 2026-06-12 — Inline Telegram-intake gate + cron no-spam policy

**Scope:** Deterministic inline gate for every Telegram intake. Cron no-spam policy.

**What was created / updated:**
- `~/.hermes/scripts/telegram-intake-gate.py` + `.sh` — 4-decision gate (ack / recall / approval / work).
- `~/.hermes/SOUL.md` § "Cron + Automation Policy — No Spam, High Signal (Hard rule — 2026-06-12)"
- `~/.hermes/knowledge/AUTOMATION_INVENTORY.md` — 25 cron jobs + 7 LaunchAgents inventoried with one-line justifications.
- Cron `378ef14a305b` — weekly MEMORY health check (Mondays 9:05 AM).

**Kanban card:** `t_kanban_inline_gate_20260612` (done).

---

## 2026-06-12 — Memory hygiene codified

**Scope:** Hard rule on `MEMORY.md` size + weekly health check.

**What was created / updated:**
- `~/.hermes/SOUL.md` § "MEMORY.md usage (Hard rule — 2026-06-12)"
- `~/.hermes/scripts/memory-health-check.py` — weekly audit script.
- All 5 profile + active MEMORY.md files reset to clean scaffold; USER.md trimmed.

**Kanban card:** documented in the MEMORY.md audit conversation; no dedicated card.

(Older entries will be backfilled from `~/.hermes/knowledge/PHASE*_*.md` files in a future audit.)
